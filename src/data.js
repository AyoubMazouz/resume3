          This project represents my end-of-year project for 2023 at ISFOO (OFPPT), and I take great pride in its development. It stands out due to its significant utility in solving a real problem we encountered, especially considering that many other projects created during that time were relatively straightforward.
          Before the creation of this application, we relied on a Python script that I developed to convert existing schedules in Excel format to PDF, as depicted in the last image and video.
          This project is a Software as a Service (SaaS) that empowers users to create schedules using either the ISFOO template or a public school template. It also offers seamless integration of new templates, allowing for easy additions through the config file.
        </p>
        <p>
          To streamline the scheduling process, the application offers a smooth user experience and various utilities for efficient schedule management and creation. Notable features include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Tracking availability:</b> The app incorporates a specialized algorithm to check the availability of professors, classrooms, and other relevant statistics. This ensures the prevention of duplicates, conflicts, or complications when using the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>User-friendly interface:</b> The application allows for exporting various settings, which is particularly useful for development purposes. Additionally, it provides the ability to import and export data to and from Excel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Import, export capability, and Excel support:</b> All essential features related to creating schedules have been designed with ease and speed in mind. For instance, once a schedule is completed, users can publish their work and share a link to their personal page, where students can conveniently download the schedule.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to these significant features, there are also smaller elements that enhance the overall user experience.
          By developing this project, my aim was to address a genuine need within the education sector and provide an efficient solution that enhances the scheduling process while streamlining administrative tasks.
