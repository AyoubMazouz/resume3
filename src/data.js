        This project represents my <b>end-of-year project for 2023 at ISFOO (OFPPT)</b>, and I take great pride in its development. It stands out due to its significant utility in solving a real problem we encountered, especially considering that many other projects created during that time were relatively straightforward.
        Before the creation of this application, we relied on a Python script that I developed to convert existing schedules in Excel format to PDF, as depicted in the last image and video.
        This project is a (SaaS) that empowers users to create schedules using either the ISFOO template or a public school template. It also offers seamless integration of new templates, allowing for easy additions through the config file.
      </p>
      <p>
        To streamline the scheduling process, the application offers a smooth user experience and various utilities for efficient schedule management and creation. Notable features include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Tracking availability:</b> The app incorporates a specialized algorithm to check the availability of professors, classrooms, and other relevant statistics. This ensures the prevention of duplicates, conflicts, or complications when using the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User-friendly interface:</b> The application allows for exporting various settings, which is particularly useful for development purposes. Additionally, it provides the ability to import and export data to and from Excel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Import, export capability, and Excel support:</b> All essential features related to creating schedules have been designed with ease and speed in mind. For instance, once a schedule is completed, users can publish their work and share a link to their personal page, where students can conveniently download the schedule.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to these significant features, there are also smaller elements that enhance the overall user experience.
        By developing this project, my aim was to address a genuine need within the education sector and provide an efficient solution that enhances the scheduling process while streamlining administrative tasks.

        During my tenure at <b>Maxmind.ma</b>, I undertook a challenging solo project involving the development of a <b>Facebook scraper extension</b>. The primary objective was to <b>extract information from Facebook groups and seamlessly integrate it into a new website</b>. The core focus of this project was on <b>speed, user-friendliness, and reliability</b>.      
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the development process, I encountered several iterations and faced numerous trials and errors. This was my first experience with a project of this nature, which brought its own set of challenges. However, my determination and dedication allowed me to overcome these hurdles and deliver an exceptional end product.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement the extension, I opted to use the efficient Svelte framework, which proved to be a wise choice for its simplicity and performance. Although optional, I also integrated <b>Chat GPT into </b>the project, further enhancing its capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the project's conclusion, we achieved a remarkable extension capable of efficiently scraping multiple websites with minimal configuration. This enabled us to seamlessly inject data into multiple other websites or endpoints, making it a versatile and powerful solution.
